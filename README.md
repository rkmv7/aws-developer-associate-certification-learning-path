# aws-developer-associate-certification-learning-path
This repository will contain my learning tasks and notes regarding studying for the AWS Developer Associate Certification.

I am completely new to AWS, and so will be approaching this learning path with that in mind. Feel free to use any material here in your own studying for the DA certification. 

The first (and most important) item to note is the TODO.md file. I have read various others' paths to studying for the certifiation, and there is no one-size-fits-all, but this path that I am laying out in the TODO is definitely to start from the ground up and build to a level of compentency that I can hopefully use to pass the exam. 

The other files in this repository will merely be my notes from various courses and practice exam questions that I encounter.
