# TODO Initial Items to Study 

## Preface
This file contains the "learning path" that I've set out for myself. As I move through the study items on this "master" checklist, there will obviously be more items that are uncovered as to what I need to study/work on. To maximize reuse of this checklist by others, I will probably create a separate checklist that contain the "follow-up" items that I need to study in order to get more familiar with unfamiliar topics.

Therefore, my goal is to make this "master" checklist fairly stable, containing the higher-level items that need to be done/studied, and the "follow-up" items checklist will be an evolving checklist particular to my situation.

## Checklist / Study Plan Composition
This study plan is comprised of a few sources. The AWS learning path for Developer Associate (https://aws.amazon.com/training/path-developing/) recommends to acquire the Cloud Practitioner certification first. My plan is to not take the actual test, but to study the materials for it as if I were.

Aside from the actual AWS documentation, I will be using acloud.guru as the primary "guide" for my understanding/knowledge acquisition, and I will be using Whizlabs as a method to practice and really understand HOW the actual certification exam will be. This idea came from this forum post (https://acloud.guru/forums/aws-cda-2018/discussion/-LTRLmtE1dtRo7tOLYv3/passed) on acloud.guru. Based on this forum post, and opinions I've read elsewhere, the acloud.guru courses are excellent for knowledge/understanding, but their practice tests were not enough. More practice is always a good thing, so that's why I will also use the Whizlabs practice tests in prep for my certification.

The checklist is also comprised of many items (FAQ, whitepapers, AWS courses) from this AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/). It contains an "A-Z plan" for studying for every AWS certification. I am using the Cloud Practitioner and Developer - Associate sections. These sections call for conducting training in a classroom setting, which in my plan will be substituted for using the acloud.guru courses, and a few online training courses put on by AWS itself.

Before creating this repository, I had actually just gone through a course on Coursera, which was an excellent introduction to the capabilities of AWS, but hardly enough to cover the required breadth of knowledge, even for a true introduction. But, I will include that course anyways, as I found it fairly useful to "test the water" so to speak.

Lastly, many of the ideas and items on this checklist also came from another course on acloud.guru, which I highly recommend taking first, called 

# Costs
Besides the actual exam, the items in the list below cost money out of pocket. The Coursera course, FAQ, whitepapers, and many of the digital AWS training courses were free.
1. acloud.guru membership
2. Whizlabs practice test package for Developer Associate
3. the "official" AWS practice test for Developer Associate.

Without further ado, here is the "master" TODO checklist for my AWS Devloper Associate Certification learning plan:
- [x] Complete Coursera "AWS Fundamentals: Building Serverless Applications" https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-fundamentals-building-serverless-applications/home/welcome. Free course with labs where you actually build an application. Not super involved, but enough to get hands dirty.
- [x] Complete acloud.guru "exam prep"
- [ ] Study whitepapers. These whitepapers were recommended by X and Y.
- [ ] Study FAQ.
Cloud Practitioner Studying
- [ ] Complete
- [ ] Complete acloud.guru "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 2019" https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner
